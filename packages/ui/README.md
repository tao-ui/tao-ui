# ðŸš§ Tao UI (unreleased) ðŸš§</h1>

## TODO

Todos will be listed here until I have my project in github officially setup.

- The original project "template" was using an override of bun test mapping to test turbo. I would think using bun test is better. But look into this.
- Eval if the script in the root is the appropriate spot
- Remove the allowing or any in TS
- Eval the convert-tw-theme file in terms of using Bun functions and the functionss usefullness in general. And how I will use TW default configs.
- Eval the types in apps/web/data

DOCS:

- all docs
- how content with Markdown works
